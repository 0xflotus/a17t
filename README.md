## Installation
a17t is available on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/a17t), and can be installed with `npm install a17t`.

## Overview

**Build beautiful, unique interfaces without reinventing the wheel. Let a17t provide the core building blocks, then customize with ease.**

Some CSS frameworks come prepackaged with all sorts of components that are convenient at first but quickly become limiting. Utility frameworks like Tailwind are awesome, but can be difficult start using on their own.

a17t tries to get the balance right. Instead of providing all-inclusive, opinionated components (like jumbotrons, navbars, and menus), a17t provides common single-class elements in a default (but easily customizable) style.

**Using a17t with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) is recommended!** While a17t can be used without Tailwind, they go very well together.

## Dependencies
If you're using a17t in your project, there are no dependencies: just import [`dist/a17t.css`](dist/a17t.css) and you're good to go! It's just a CSS file. Nothing more, nothing less.

If you'd like to contribute to a17t or integrate it into your build process, be sure to install all the dependencies in the [`package.json`](package.json).

More information about customization and contributing will be available soon. In the meantime, here's the core info you need to know: a17t is built using many of Tailwind's shorthand utilities, as well as PostCSS. It uses CSS variables to pass contextual values (like text colors, heading colors, etc.).
